pkg-kde-tools (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  HTML_INSTALL_DIR path has been switched from /usr/share/doc/kde4/HTML to
  /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML. If you refer to usr/share/doc/kde4/ anywhere in the
  packaging (esp. debian/*.install or debian/rules files), replace it with
  /usr/share/doc/kde/ and bump pkg-kde-tools build dependency to (>= 0.9).
