Description: various packaging tools and scripts for KDE Applications
 This package contains a variety of packaging tools and build scripts that may
 be very useful when packaging KDE applications. Even if you are a maintainer
 of a very small KDE application, this package should be worthwhile checking
 out.
 .
 Main highlights:
  - recommended build flags for building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - cdbs class for building packages based on the KDE Platform (kde.mk);
  - debhelper build system (--buildsystem=kde) and dh addon (--with kde) for
    building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - dh_sameversiondep for generating a dependency that is versioned the same
    way as a dependency (coming from the same source) of another reference
    package.
  - dh_movelibkdeinit for moving libkdeinit4_*.so libraries to private
    location;
  - dh_sodeps (and sodeps dh addon) for generating so:Depends substvar for -dev
    packages based to which local packages lib*.so symlinks point to;
  - pkgkde-symbolshelper tool for efficient management of C and C++ symbol
    files;
  - pkgkde-debs2symbols tool for generating symbol files and symbol file
    patches from pre-built binaries in the deb packages;
  - pkgkde-getbuildlogs tool for downloading build logs for the specified
    package (from buildd.debian.org);
  - pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest tool for overriding Breaks of the
    kde-sc-dev-latest package;
  - pkgkde-vcs tool for performing common tasks when packaging under VCS.
 .
 NOTE: since this package is cumulative, it does not depend on the packages it
 provides helpers for. I.e. you still need to explicitly build depend on
 debhelper or cdbs in your packages.

Package: libdlrestrictions1
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: library that implements library compatibility checks for dlopen()
 This package provides a DLRestrictions library that can be used to check
 compatibility of the external shared library (or plugin) against other
 libraries currently loaded in the global symbol object. It might help to avoid
 symbol clashes and provide means for graceful failure detection in advance
 before the first dlsym() call. Otherwise, usage of incompatible library might
 result in crashes or other unpredictable failures of the application.
 .
 A shared library that is protected by DLRestrictions provides a special symbol
 which defines conditions under which the library may be safely used. At the
 moment, the only restriction that may be imposed controls whether multiple
 SONAMEs of the same library can safely co-exist in the same symbol space.
 Shared library dependencies are also checked for compatibility.

Package: libdlrestrictions-dev
Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: libdlrestrictions1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: development files for the DLRestrictions library
 This package provides development files needed to build both shared libraries,
 which specify their compatibility restrictions, and applications, which check
 whether those restrictions are satisfied before using those libraries. The
 package also contains a CMake module which simplifies building DLRestricted
 shared libraries with CMake.
